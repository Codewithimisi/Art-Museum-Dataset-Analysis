## Some SQL Functions Used
- Joins: Utilized to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.
- Subqueries: Used to nest one query within another to retrieve data or perform calculations.
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Employed to create temporary result sets for use within the main query.
- Window Functions: Applied to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row within a query result.
